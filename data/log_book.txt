1. stick_test       - 24-09-25  - Test for dilution stick and VNA. Shows that there is a shift in the intensity over time

2. lock-in-time     - 24-10-8   - Test for variation in the lockin voltage over time. Shows a clear shift in time, even when nothing is done. Lockin is no longer used

3. 24-10-15         - 24-10-15  - Test with new antennas. Shows:
                                    1. Test of cavity from 1-30V 1001 point per V. Cavity resonance is at ca. 2.35 GHz
                                    2. Test from 1-60V 1001 point per V. Anti-crossing is at ca. 46.6V
                                    3. Test from 30-60V 1001 point per V. Anti-crossing is at ca. 48.2V
                                    4. Test from 30-60V 10001 point per V. Anti-crossing is at ca. 55V. Coils are too hot to touch

                                    Clearly shows that the resistance in the coils increases with heat. This is a problem, as it means the entire setup needs to 
                                    be cooled down to get a good measurement. This is a bit worrying...Also gives a good reason to do a temperature measurement 
                                    of the coils (Temp vs time for different voltages, apply machine learning to predict the temperature of the coils, and how
                                    this will affect the measurement)
                                    
                                    Next time:  Measure the temperature, get good way of transfering from V to mT, test out envelope function, and the circultor

4. Power            - 15.11.26  - Test of the power of the system with time. To find which dB is best for anti-crossing measurements
                                    Best at -15 dB

5. Temperature      - 24.11.26  - Test of the temperature of the system with time. At 45V, at 22 C, this is right above the anticrossing
